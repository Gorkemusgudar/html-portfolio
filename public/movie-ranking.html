<h1>The Best Movies According to GÃ¶rkem</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><h3>American Gangster</h3></li>
<p>I love Denzel Washington's acting how he talk with people and give a life to such a bad person
   as an actor. 
</p>
<li><h3>I am Legend</h3></li>
<p>Always waited for zombie apocalypse (don't worry just kidding) </p>
<li><h3>Soul</h3></li>
<p>This cartoon  movie reminds me we have only 1 life and 1 chance so we don't spend it 
   with negative things.
